# Pure Abode corresponds to a clean home and that is the gist of this initiative. Team Moriarty strives to restore cleanliness in rural and urban ares of India by providing a platform to every citizen. Registering a complaint for the same is as simple as visiting a website and filling out a form mentioning the address of the place. Videos and pictures of the place can also bee uploaded through this platform.

# Pure Abode provides rewards to active users for their valuable contributions and an opportunity  to make a difference by volunteering to help us clean their neighbouring areas. Also we focus on continuous improvement which is achieved by suggestions of our users provided through the feedback form on the website.
